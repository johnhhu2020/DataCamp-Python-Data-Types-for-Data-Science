    "## Determining set differences\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of comparing sets is to use the difference() method. It returns all the items found in one set but not another. It's important to remember the set you call the method on will be the one from which the items are returned. Unlike tuples, you can add() items to a set. A set will only add items that do not exist in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll explore what names were common in 2011, but are no longer common in 2014. The set baby_names_2014 has been pre-loaded into your workspace. As in the previous exercise, the names have been converted to title case to ensure a proper comparison.\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "100 XP\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create an empty set called baby_names_2011. You can do this using set().\n",
    "    Use a for loop to iterate over each row in records:\n",
    "        If the first column of each row in records is '2011', add its fourth column to baby_names_2011. Remember that Python is 0-indexed!\n",
    "    Find the difference between baby_names_2011 and baby_names_2014. Store the result as differences.\n",
    "    Print the differences. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the result!\n",

    "You'll now use a DictReader to load up a dictionary to hold your data with the district as the key and the rest of the data in a list. The csv, defaultdict, and datetime modules have already been imported for you.\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "100 XP\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create a Python file object in read mode for crime_sampler.csv called csvfile.\n",

    "    Loop over a DictReader of the CSV file:\n",
    "        Pop 'District' from each row and store it as district.\n",
    "        Append the rest of the data (row) to the district key of crimes_by_district.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "    To create a Python file object in read mode, pass in the name of the CSV file and the keyword argument 'r' to the open() function.\n",
    "    Use defaultdict(list) to create a dictionary that defaults to a list.\n",
    "    Use csv.DictReader() with the name of the file object as the argument in your loop.\n",
    "    Use the .pop() method on row with 'District' as the argument.\n",
    "    Use district as the key to crimes_by_district and append row to it.\n"
