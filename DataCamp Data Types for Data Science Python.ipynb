If you have a tuple like ('chocolate chip cookies', 15) and you want to access each part of the data, you can use an index just like a list. However, you can also \"unpack\" the tuple into multiple variables such as type, count = ('chocolate chip cookies', 15) that will set type to 'chocolate chip cookies' and count to 15.\n",

    "## Determining set differences\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of comparing sets is to use the difference() method. It returns all the items found in one set but not another. It's important to remember the set you call the method on will be the one from which the items are returned. Unlike tuples, you can add() items to a set. A set will only add items that do not exist in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll explore what names were common in 2011, but are no longer common in 2014. The set baby_names_2014 has been pre-loaded into your workspace. As in the previous exercise, the names have been converted to title case to ensure a proper comparison.\n",

    "    Create an empty set called baby_names_2011. You can do this using set().\n",
    "    Use a for loop to iterate over each row in records:\n",
    "        If the first column of each row in records is '2011', add its fourth column to baby_names_2011. Remember that Python is 0-indexed!\n",
    "    Find the difference between baby_names_2011 and baby_names_2014. Store the result as differences.\n",
