# DataCamp-Python-Data-Types-for-Data-Science



## Fundamental data types

This chapter will introduce you to the fundamental Python data types - lists, sets, and tuples. These data containers are critical as they provide the basis for storing and looping over ordered data. To make things interesting, you'll apply what you learn about these types to answer questions about the New York Baby Names dataset!

## Dictionaries - the root of Python

At the root of all things Python is a dictionary. Herein, you'll learn how to use them to safely handle data that can viewed in a variety of ways to answer even more questions about the New York Baby Names dataset. You'll explore how to loop through data in a dictionary, access nested data, add new data, and come to appreciate all of the wonderful capabilities of Python dictionaries.

## Meet the collections module

The collections module is part of Python's standard library and holds some more advanced data containers. You'll learn how to use the Counter, defaultdict, OrderedDict and namedtuple in the context of answering questions about the Chicago transit dataset.

## Handling Dates and Times

Handling times can seem daunting at time, but here, you'll dig in and learn how to create datetime objects, print them, look to the past and to the future. Additionally, you'll learn about some third party modules that can make all of this easier. You'll continue to use the Chicago Transit dataset to answer questions about transit times.
